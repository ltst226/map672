    <h1>Web mapping with a cartographer, coder, and critic</h1>
    
    <p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript programming and mapping.</p>

    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>

    <p>In reference to The Floating Sheep Manifesto, I found the essay to be an interesting piece in the history and future of mapping. It provided an interesting perspective into all of the arguments to mapping into today’s society. In reference to what position I find myself in the world of mapping, I find myself to be in with the coders persona. I like using data and how it can convert into maps. I have a personal interest in crime mapping and using maps for emergency management. With that being said, I also like to have perfection.</p>
    
    <p>I am very early into my mapping experience and want to build my experience to get to that perfection level. In my mapping a career, I will be setting crime statistics, crime mapping, and safety data as the priority in my mapping. My profession covers the safety of communities; therefore, I have the goal to make mapping the world of policing and emergency management that of a useful tool that will make communities safer.</p>
    
    <p>Of the six manifesto points, I find the one that is the most provocative is point number 2.
    The point states, “All maps lie but lies are the source of maps’ power.” Maps can be created for any reason and show anything the author wants. Just like a picture is worth a 1000 words, maps can have the same effect. A well-executed map can have a tremendous amount of power to help persuade the reader in one way or the other. The lies that are in maps can come from the projection (like it is stated in the essay), or it can come from the data that was gathered. The quote accredited to Mark Twain comes to mind when I see this point, “There are lies, damned lies, and statistics.” The data used by the author can be misinterpreted, either on purpose or on accident, and it can persuade the reader. Summing up, the author of the map has the capability to hold a great deal of power in their hand’s when publishing maps to their community and the author must think what is the purpose and am I showing the public the
    information in the correct way.</p>
